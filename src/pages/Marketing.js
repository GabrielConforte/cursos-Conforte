       consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
       and going through the cites of the word
       in classical literature, discovered the
       "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
       (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
       written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
       on the theory of ethics,
       very popular during the Renaissance.
       The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
       "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
       comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
